The Department of Instrumentation Technology started in the year 1991. More than twenty five batches of Engineers have graduated from Department of Instrumentation Technology, B.M.S College of Engineering.
The program name has been changed by VTU as Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering with effect from, 2014 batch onwards. Currently the program offers Under Graduate (UG) degree with an intake of 60. The Department Infrastructure fulfills the requirements of academics and learning skills on the latest technology in the industry. Dedicated faculty with Ph.D who are into Research and Development activities at Institution level, Qualified technical staff and enthusiastic and intelligent students are the strength of the department.
A well designed curriculum takes the student through basics of Engineering, core domain and development of competencies by the effective usage of Modern Engineering Tools like: MATLAB, LabVIEW, Multisim, Xilinx, Code-Composer-Studio, Simulation tools, PCB design labs, process control loops and PLCs applications. The department has strong industry collaborations in the field of Sensors, Automation Control, IoT solutions through Professional bodies as well as through faculty contacts. Their contribution is reflected through guidance in curriculum design, organization of industrial visits, conduction of expert lectures, organization of workshops, and joint research. One of the important developmental activity of the department in latest years is to draw together key stakeholders viz. Alumni, employers, Faculty, Industries, Professional bodies and students in a neutral venue, one that allows them to discuss issues and foster collaborative activities around issues in which they have a strong common interest for the growth of the department.

The department projects are adjudged as BEST Projects at Institution level as well as at different intercollegiate competitions. The department prepares the graduating engineers so that they are able to pursue a successful professional career in the outside world. The quality of the graduating students is reflected in good on-campus/off-campus recruitments, in core and allied industries up to 80% among the eligible candidates. A significant number of our graduates pursue higher education in Engineering/ Management in prestigious Universities in India and abroad.
Department has been accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) under Tier â€“I, Washington Accord.
